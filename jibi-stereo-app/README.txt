Jibi Stereo
===========

This app is a read-only helper that guides you to the folders needed for your Discord stereo setup.
Notes:
- Make sure your discord is closed
- Make sure you have BetterDiscord already installed
- Detect: detects if you have discord, and locates its local folder
- Voice: opens the Discord voice module folder
- BD Plugins: opens BetterDiscord plugins folder
- Logs: opens the logs folder
- Diagnostics: writes a diagnostics report to help troubleshooting
- If something breaks, reinstall Discord to restore defaults.

How to use:
1) Run JibiStereo.exe
2) If it says Discord is running, close Discord first.
3) Click Detect
4) Click Voice
5) Open "Voice Modules" folder and copy and paste all of the files to the "voice module folder"
6) If you do not have the BetterDiscord StereoPlugin, click "BD Plugins: to open the BD Plugins folder, get the plugin from "Stereo Plugin" folder, copy and paste them to the "BD Plugins" folder.
7) Open Discord
8) If you've just installed the StereoPlugin, go to Discord Settings/Plugins, and enable the plugin (and any plugins that connects to this)

You should now have Stereo Audio :>
