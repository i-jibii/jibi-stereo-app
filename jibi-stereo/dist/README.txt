Jibi Stereo
===========

This app is a read-only helper that guides you to the folders needed for your Discord stereo setup.

How to use:
1) Run JibiStereo.exe
2) If it says Discord is running, close Discord first.
3) Click Detect
4) Use these buttons as needed:
   - Voice: opens the Discord voice module folder
   - BD Plugins: opens BetterDiscord plugins folder
   - Logs: opens the logs folder
   - Diagnostics: writes a diagnostics report to help troubleshooting

Notes:
- This tool does not change Discord files by itself.
- If something breaks, reinstall Discord to restore defaults.
